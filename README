To compile this program, change directory to this project folder in terminal and type:
python3 showOutput.py fasta.txt

To run any other fasta file just place it inside the project folder 
and replace "fasta.txt" with the name of the file as the second command argument. 

As a side note, the output will look better if this window is run in full screen. 
When minimizing my console window, it got a little confusing to see the data.
