To compile this program, change directory to this project folder in terminal and type:
python3 showOutput.py fasta.txt

To run any other fasta file just place it inside the project folder 
and replace "fasta.txt" with the name of the file as the second command argument. 

I have attached a screenshot of my output when running this program using the fasta.txt
file found in this folder.

As a side note, the output will look better if this window is run in full screen. 
When minimizing my console window, it got a little confusing to see the data.
